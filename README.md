  ## Description

Sal Social Network was made to learn more about working with noSql databases, mongoDB and Mongoose. It also helped me understand how the routing and controllers for such an application will differ from a Sql based application. After haviing completed this project, I have learnt the basics of how to build and work with a noSql based database.
